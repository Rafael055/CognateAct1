    <h1>About US</h1>
    <p>FOUNDED IN 2024</p>
<h3>History</h3>
<p>The group was originally named "OGAE,” inspired by our cognate project titled <em>“Optimizing Growth: Arduino-Enabled Greenhouse with Auto Watering System Manual.”</em> Over time, the name evolved into “OGAY,” since our group grew bigger.</p>

<h3>Why the name "OGAY"?</h3>
<p>The name “OGAY” was chosen as a simpler, catchier version of the original "OGAE.” It symbolizes teamwork, and the fun yet meaningful journey of turning concepts into real prototypes.</p>

<h3>What is OGAY?</h3>
<p>OGAY is a group dedicated to developing prototypes that transform ideas into practical solutions. We aim to address challenges, spark innovation, and inspire others to explore new possibilities through creativity and collaboration.</p>
